# nexus-move-endgame-mark

`nexus-move-endgame-mark` explores chess and game engines in Elixir. The repository keeps the core rule set compact, then surrounds it with examples that show how the decisions move.

## Nexus Move Endgame Mark Notes

The quickest review path is the verifier first, then the fixtures, then the operations note. That order makes it easy to see whether the code, data, and explanation still agree.

## Why This Exists

This is not a wrapper around a service. It is a self-contained project that shows how the model behaves when demand, capacity, latency, risk, and weight move in different directions.

## Code Tour

- `lib`: library code
- `test`: language test directory
- `fixtures`: compact golden scenarios
- `examples`: expanded scenario set
- `metadata`: project constants and verification metadata
- `docs`: operations and extension notes
- `scripts`: local verification and audit commands

## Feature Notes

- Includes extended examples for turn flow, including `recovery` and `degraded`.
- Documents search limits tradeoffs in `docs/operations.md`.
- Runs locally with a single verification command and no external credentials.
- Stores project constants and verification metadata in `metadata/project.json`.
- Adds a repository audit script that checks structure before running the language verifier.

## Implementation Notes

The interesting part is the boundary between accepted and reviewed scenarios. Extended examples sit near that boundary so future edits can show whether the model became more permissive or more cautious. The Elixir project uses Mix and ExUnit with clear data maps for each scenario.

## Local Setup

Clone the repository, enter the directory, and run the verifier. No database server, cloud account, or token is required.

## Example Scenarios

The extended cases are not random smoke tests. `degraded` keeps pressure on the review path, while `recovery` shows the model when capacity and weight are strong enough to clear the threshold.

## Try It

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/verify.ps1
```

This runs the language-level build or test path against the compact fixture set.

## Tests

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/audit.ps1
```

The audit command checks repository structure and README constraints before it delegates to the verifier.

## Roadmap

- Split the scoring constants into a typed configuration object and validate it before use.
- Add a comparison mode that shows how decisions change when one signal is adjusted.
- Add a loader for `examples/extended_cases.csv` and promote selected cases into the language test suite.
- Add one more chess and game engines fixture that focuses on a malformed or borderline input.

## Boundaries

The fixture set is deliberately small. That keeps the review surface clear, but it also means the model should not be treated as a complete domain simulator.
